# Preface 

I am very grateful to be selected in this free bootcamp opportunity which is sponsored by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in partnership with Jakarta Machine Learning (JML) starting from September 25, 2020. 
This bootcamp is a biweekly 3 month long program that will prepare all nine bootcampers to learn about deep reinforcement learning using a 1/18th scale autonomous self-driving car. 

A little bit about JML, it is a very welcoming machine learning community that routinely run webinars (because of Covid-19 pandemic) about various machine learning topics, from deep learning, natural language processing,  deployment and so on. 

I didn't expect that I would be chosen as a participant, so this is pretty new for me, and in blogging part as well. I plan to share everything I learned from this bootcamp in this series of blog posts. This blog is intended for newbies in reinforcement learning, or anyone who interested to start learning (the fun way) in machine learning world. 

Thanks to Mas Imam, Mas Ricky, Mbak Erika and other JML members who initiated this amazing bootcamp. Big thanks to Mas Donnie and Mr. Suman who enthusiastically teaching us about all the details in DeepRacer. And of course, thanks to AWS who sponsors us!

Without further ado, let's start the engine!

Regards,
